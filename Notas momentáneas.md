When I was a child, my mom used to take me to kindergarten on her bike. I went to the same kindergarten and school until I finished elementary school. I used to do many activities. In the afternoons, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I used to go to taekwondo. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I used to do my homework. On weekends, friends would always come over to spend the afternoon. On Sundays, we would go to my paternal grandmother's house for lunch. My favorite part was going to taekwondo training and hanging out with my friends. What I liked least was doing homework.

When I was a kid I ate chicken but there was a time when my mom could only eat that and after a while of only being able to eat that, I never wanted to eat it again until 1 year ago.
At that time I really liked playing toy soldiers and Doom 1 on my dad's computer.
Last year I dedicated myself to working and studying backend in javascript, during the pandemic I worked as security for a private property and trained at home, five years ago I was studying psychology and trained every day and those routines changed because I left psychology because I didn't like it and started working.

Hola, algunos buenos y malos modales en argentina, para empezar los argentinos somos muy cariñosos, cuando saludamos a alguien lo solemos hacer con un beso y un abrazo, siempre pedir por favor y gracias, Masticar con la boca cerrada, no hablar con la boca llena, 
respetar a los mayores ser solidario. Aunque usamos la palabra "boludo" para llamar a un amigo, sigue siendo un insulto, y hablando de insultos no decir hola, buenos dias, por favor y muchas gracias son incluso peores que un insulto. Ser puntual es muy importante para muchas personas, por lo que llegar tarde es mal visto, de igual modo siempre se tiene una tolerancia de al menos 10 a 15 minutos.


Argentines are very affectionate. When greeting someone, we usually give a kiss on the cheek and a hug. It is important to use expressions like please and thanks to show courtesy. Chewing with your mouth closed and not talking with your mouth full are considered basic manners. Respecting elders and being helpful to others are also expected. While we use the word "boludo" to refer to friends, it is still an insult. Avoid using insults or offensive language, even if not directed at someone specific. It is considered rude not to greet, say good morning, please and thanks. Punctuality is valued in Argentina. Arriving late for an event or appointment may be frowned upon. However, there's a general tolerance of 10 to 15 minutes.

It was when I was competing in an international taekwondo tournament here in Argentina. They filmed 2 of my fights, they were intense fights. I remember fighting in the semifinals with a very fast boy, and that in the final I fought against a deaf-mute who also boxed. They asked me several questions, such as what my martial school was, who my teacher was, I told them that the school is called "Baedku" and that my teachers are Jorge Teso and Horacio De Luca. It was entertaining although I was quite nervous, it was my first time on television. After that tournament I stopped competing and started dedicating myself to training the next generations.

In 2017, while competing in UIAMA an international taekwondo tournament here in Argentina, I found myself on TV. They filmed two of my fights, which were incredibly intense. On the semifinal match my opponent was really fast. In the final, I faced a deaf competitor who was also skilled in boxing. Afterward, they interviewed me, asking about my martial arts background. I told them my school is called "Baedku" and that I train under Jorge Teso and Horacio De Luca. It was a thrilling experience, though I have to admit I was quite nervous – it was my television debut! Following that tournament, I decided to step away from competition and focus on training the next generation of taekwondo athletes.
